##This is My Term Project for CS601

### Introduction

The full version of my website consists of 6 HTML interfaces and includes 4 javascript. The home page is a file named "home.html". I've put all the CSS files in the styles directory and all the photos and icons in the "assets" directory. All JavaScript files can be found in a folder called "js". I host my project on Git Hub. If you need to visit the live website, please click this link: https://zhu01.github.io/home.html.

In order to make my code more readable, I split my javascript part into five JavaScript files and named them with simple and clear names.

For what it's worth, I have a total of six pages in my navbar. But after the user submits their information, they will be redirected to the https://formspree.io/thanks page. This page is just a form submission confirmation page, it should not be included in the main navigation, because that doesn't make sense. However, there is a back button on this page, so when the user clicks "Go Back", they can continue browsing my site.

### navigation
* All pages on the website can be accessed through the navigation bar. In each interface, I looked for an icon that is the most suitable for this interface, so that each interface seems more beautiful.
* The main navigation bar has a clean and uncluttered design, allowing you to easily navigate the site. At the same time, I used color to distinguish which interface the user is currently on.
* When the user's mouse moves over the navigation bar or button, there will be a color change to let the user know that the mouse has moved to the correct position. There will also be additional underlining hints when moving over the navbar.
* All hyperlinks, whether in or outside the navigation, have meaning in their names.

### CSS styles
* I use different CSS files for different interfaces and extract some common styles into separate files.
* I have used a variety of selectors, including class selectors, element/type selectors, id selectors, and descendant selectors. My goal is to focus as much as possible on element/type and class selectors to ensure more reusable code.
* I deliberately chose colors easily recognizable across the site and on surfaces so nothing is hard to read.
* I have chosen a theme color for my website. And use orange as an accent to ensure the consistency of the website. You'll see these colors across the site.

### Contact data web
* I'm using formspress.io for my receiving form data. Formspree.io is a service that provides an easy way to add forms to your website and handle form submissions without server-side code.
* It simplifies the process of creating and managing forms by handling form submissions and sending you data via email or integrating with other tools.
* I used the form template provided by Formspree.io and added some custom HTML form elements
* Processing form submissions: When a user submits a form on your website, Formspree.io processes the form data and sends it to the email address you provided during setup. This allows me to receive form submissions directly in my inbox. And be able to reply to the user who submitted the form as soon as possible.
