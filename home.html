          My name is <b>Lingyi Zhu</b>, or you can call me Leo, and I just
          graduated from the CS program at BU MET. I have many hobbies, such as
          photography and coffee. I started to get into boutique coffee in 2018.
          My good friend took me to many boutique coffee shops, and then I
          gradually started to learn about coffee. In the summer of 2019, I
          became a barista. Then after working for a while, I decided to
          continue studying. So I came to Boston University in 2020.
          Coincidentally, the
          <a href="https://sca.coffee" target="_blank">SCA</a> held a coffee
          show in Boston in 2020. The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) is a
          trade association built on foundations of openness, inclusivity, and
          the power of shared knowledge. I had a lot of fun at the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now back to my major. wo started learning something about front-end. I
          learned something about react and decided to take CS601 to learn more
          about web development. My undergraduate degree is in computer science
          from Auburn University. The more I learn about CS and all the possible
          career paths within it, the less sure I am about what I really want to
          do after graduation. I will be graduating at
          <time datetime="2023-12">Dec 2023</time>. Currently, I am working on
          becoming a full-stack developer, after mastering back-end development.
          I hope to learn more about front-end development from this course.
