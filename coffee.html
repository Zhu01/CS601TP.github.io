        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
          I have many hobbies, and coffee is one of my hobbies that brings a lot
          of fun to my life. As a former barista I would like to introduce you
          to some interesting things about coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is a great barista. He makes videos about anything coffee
          related, occasionally food, sometimes business/entrepreneurship. He
          also wrote The World Coffee Map and How to Make the Best Coffee at
          Home. I have a lot of respect for this barista and if you are
          interested you can check out his YouTube page:

        <p>
          When I was first know coffee, I thought coffee only had two flavors,
          acid and bitter. But in my time as a barista, I gradually learned
          about the flavors of coffee. There are dozens of hundreds of flavors
          that can be tasted in coffee. I would like to introduce you to a tool
          that baristas commonly use to describe flavors.

          <h3>Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel</h3>
          <p>
            The Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel is a tool used by coffee
            professionals to describe and categorize the various flavors and
            aromas present in coffee. It was developed by the Specialty Coffee
            Association (SCA) in collaboration with World Coffee Research to
            provide a standardized vocabulary for discussing coffee flavor
            profiles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Flavor Wheel is a circular diagram that organizes coffee flavors
            into different categories and subcategories. At the center of the
            wheel, there are broad categories such as "sweet" and "sour," which
            represent the basic taste attributes of coffee. As you move
            outwards, the wheel becomes more detailed, with more specific
            flavors and aromas. The outer rim of the Flavor Wheel contains
            descriptors for complex and specific flavors that can be found in
            coffee, such as "floral," "citrus," "caramel," "chocolate," "nutty,"
            "spicy," and many more. These descriptors help tasters articulate
            and communicate the nuanced characteristics of different coffees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel is a valuable tool for coffee
            professionals, including tasters, roasters, and baristas, as it
            facilitates discussions about coffee flavors and assists in quality
            control, sourcing decisions, and overall appreciation of the
            beverage. It enables tasters to communicate effectively and
            consistently about the sensory experiences associated with different
            coffees.

          <p>
            Pour-over coffee is a brewing method that involves manually pouring
            hot water over coffee grounds to extract the flavors and aromas.
            It's a popular technique known for its simplicity and ability to
            produce a clean, flavorful cup of coffee.
